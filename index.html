   <p> We can all agree that <em>birds is the best</em>. </p>

   <p> One of the best birds is definitely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">goose</a>. This is due to their murderous tendencies and general proclivity for violence. </p>

     <p><strong>cedric the bloody</strong> is one of the most notoriously malevolent geese to walk the earth. his thirst for suffering knew no bounds.</p>

     <h3>favourite activities of cedric the bloody</h3>
     <ul>
      <li>nipping ankles of disabled children</li>
      <li>beating wings at disabled elderlies</li>
      <li>honking loudly at disabled animals</li>
     </ul>

     <p>whilst his terrors mostly targeted the disabled, his attitude to all non-goose life forms was poor and nobody was safe.</p>
